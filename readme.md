This sceduler was using a mix of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, and Jquery. The user can input any value of there choosing into the text area field and use the save button on the right of that field to save their changes to local storage. Upon the next load so long as the local storage still exists then the user will be presented with their previously saved items. These are dynamically update like the background color using Java Script.

Upon load the user will also be presented with the current date at the top of the calendar for ease of use of date tracking.

This workday scheduler was created to showcase my JS and moment skill sets as well as utilizing bootstrap for easy desing with my own overrides for my customized look and feel.
